Node.js, by default, treats JavaScript files as CommonJS modules. To use ES modules (which allow the import and export syntax), you need to explicitly tell Node.js to treat your files as ES modules. There are two ways to do this:

Option 1: Set "type": "module" in package.json
Open or create a package.json file in your project directory.
Add "type": "module" to your package.json file.

Option 2: Use the .mjs Extension
Rename your files to have a .mjs extension:

utils.js -> utils.mjs
main.js -> main.mjs

With this setup, you can use the import and export syntax in your JavaScript files without any issues.
